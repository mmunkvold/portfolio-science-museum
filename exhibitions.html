          <h1>Our Exhibitions</h1>
          <p>
            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to life through exhibits. This is why we have over
            <strong>1000 different exhibits</strong> on the many varied subjects of science to explore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of these exhibits are designed for you to <strong>interact with</strong> and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
            dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home...).

          <h2>Accessibility at the Museum</h2>
          <p>
            Science should also be <strong>accessible to everyone</strong>, so we strive to make our museum and all of our exhibitions as accessible
            as possible. We want everyone to feel welcome and taken care of while visiting us.

          <p>
            Explore the <strong>wonders of our cosmos</strong>. Our fantastic exhibition, <strong>"The Sky Above Us"</strong>, explores the night sky
            and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn
            a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
          </p>
          <p>
            Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in
            our solar system.

          <h2>Biology and Medicine - "Building Blocks of Life"</h2>
          <p>
            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of
            medicine. Over a series of exhibits we <strong>explore the history of medicine</strong> and take a look at some major breakthroughs
            including the <strong>discovery of penicillin</strong> and the <strong>first heart transplant</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow
            creatures have beat us to it.

          <p>

          <h2>Evolution - "Meet Woolly Mammoth"</h2>
          <p>
            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here?
            Since Darwin proposed his <strong>theory of evolution</strong> we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved over time. You can also take some time to meet
            a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our <strong>Woolly Mammoth</strong>, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

          <p>One of our most popular exhibitions are <strong>"When the Dinosaurs Roamed the Earth"</strong>.</p>

            This exhibition have <strong>real-size dinosaur skeletons</strong> to really show off how big the dinosaurs where (and how small we humans
            are...).

          <h2>Ecology - "Make Our Future Greener"</h2>
          <p>
            As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to
            <strong>create a sustainable future</strong> not just for humans but for the whole planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including
            <strong>global warming, extinction of species, and pollution</strong>. But we also <strong>focus on the positive ways</strong> we can all
            contribute to a brighter future.
