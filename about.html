            Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to <strong>making science accessible to all</strong>. This means that
            we do what we can to provide a good experience for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>aim</strong> of our museum is to create a space where everyone can <strong>experience the wonders</strong> of our discoveries
            and perhaps even <strong>ignite a lifelong passion</strong> to continue the exploration of the world around us.
          </p>

          <h2>We strive to be accessible for everyone!</h2>
          <p>
            The museum has <strong>wheelchair accessibility ramps</strong>. Outside we have handicap parking designated near the entrance for easy
            access. The entrance doors, and emergency exits are double doors and easy to open.
          </p>
          <p>We have <strong>audio guides</strong> available and <strong>braille display signs</strong> for the visually impaired.</p>
          <p>
            All areas are designed so that there is good space to get around. In times with lots of visitors, it might be a bit crowded. There are
            usually fewer visitors during morning hours on the weekdays. On the weekends there are usually more visitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't have an assistent with you, <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> in advance and we will arrange for you to have someone
            taking care of your when you visit us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also welcome babies and their baby-carriages, but if you do have smaller carriages to use at the museum that is very much apprecciated
            as the space get crowded when there are a lot of visitors. We have some smaller ones for you to use when you are visiting, but the numbers
            are limited.
